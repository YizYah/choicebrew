        types:
          - name: FlowType
            category: enum
            description: >-
              Options for a flow in a Choice.  Currently just BACK (exit the
              menu or submenu) and COMMAND (execute a command).  Almost always
              you will want to set a Choice to COMMAND, because by default a
              BACK Choice is created for you automatically unless you override
              that with your own.  But see the setFlow function, which allows
              you to dynamically change a flow to BACK inside of an executing
              ChoiceCallback.
          - name: SelectedInfo
            description: >-
              specifying a selection.  Consists of a FlowType enum value 'flow'
              and any 'value' assigned to the choice.
            category: interface
          - name: MenuAnswers
            description: >-
              consists of simply 'selected', which is an instance of
              SelectedInfo.
            category: interface
          - name: SelectedInfo
            description: >-
              specifying a selection.  Consists of a FlowType enum value 'flow'
              and any 'value' assigned to the choice.
            category: interface
          - name: Choice
            description: >-
              The information for a choice, including the 'flow' (a FlowType,
              almost always COMMAND), a 'name' string, and a number of options.
              You can assign the following inquirer fields for a choice:
              description, value, short version.  Also, a callback function.

          - name: menu
            type: function
            description: >-
              takes a ChoiceGenerator and continuously prompts the user for
              choices until a choice with the FlowType BACK is selected. When a
              choice with FlowType BACK is selected, the menu exits. You can
              also call setFlow in the callback for a choice to set the FlowType
              to BACK dynamically, thereby exiting the menu after execution of
              the callback.
          - name: getValue
            type: function
            description: >-
              returns the value entered or selected by a user.  This is useful
              in the callback for a ChoiceCallback
          - name: setFlow
            type: function
            description: >-
              sets the flow for a Choice to be a FlowType.  Normally, this is
              only useful for setting flow to BACK in a ChoiceCallback.  Doing
              that will result in the menu exiting after the ChoiceCallback
              executes.  For instance, it will exit a submenu and return to the
              menu above.
